The Little Launcher 0.1

Overview
========
"The Little Launcher" is an application launcher, it will change the way you
start running application.

When you run it a small window will pop up, write the alias to your
application and some parameters and it will run.

Installation
============
o Unzip the package to a known directory.
o Edit your configuration file ($HOME/.launchrc in Unix and
  /install/dir/_launchrc in Windows).
  (See example rcfile)
o Create a shortcut to launch program and assign it a "Shortcut Key"
o Hit the "Shortcut Key" combination and run your applications

Why Did I Do It?
================
My desktop got so many icons, each one with different shortcut key. I started
to forget how to start what.
Then I found SlickRun (http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/) and it is wonderful.
You need to remember only *one* shortcut key (CTRL+SHIFT+J in my case) and
then run the application from a symbolic name ("www" for web browser, "chess"
to run arena chess, "music" to open the music player ..)

However SlickRun runs only on windows and it's *always* in memory (taking
about 7MB). So I've decided to role my own. It still has a long way to go
before reaching SlickRun's GUI but it's enough for me.
